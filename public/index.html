<p>Here is where I share my thoughts about every other vanilla topic out there &mdash; I&rsquo;ve gone through so much drama already.</p>
<p>I plan for this tiny static website to be my online shelf of sorts. I want it to be a place where my thoughts reside &mdash; and maybe some recipes too. Expect mostly journal entries. And expect them every now and then; I don&rsquo;t plan on having a schedule for this.</p>
<p>I am also thinking about doing some tutorials and writing articles about interesting stuff I encounter while studying. But that&rsquo;s not here or there. I don&rsquo;t want to commit to anything so far.</p>

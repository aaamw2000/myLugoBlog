<p>I hate it so much. I wish I was &ldquo;normal&rdquo; &ndash; whatever that is. I am truly different in (almost) every possible way. I think differently, value differnet things, and behave in an entirely differnet fashion. There is no other way around it &ndash; I am just different.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education?</h2>
<p>Could this truly be an educational gap? Or am I sucking myself off big time here? In a sense, I feel like everything I read is in fact a factor, but is it the only one? Probably not. And as I am pretty sure lots of people will point out, my lack of family and/or my childhood isolation is also a factor &ndash; no avoiding that fact either.</p>

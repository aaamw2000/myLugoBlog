&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-it-is-at&#34;&gt;Where it is at&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know how to begin with this comrades, but I am saddened to say it &amp;mdash; I need the cash. Life is in no way, shape, or form easy at the current moment. I have literally lost everything and I am more or less starting all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I have an oral exam tomorrow for a course I did not study much for, yet I am here typing this out. Who would have thought, huh? I certainly would not have expected me to end up here. But I guess everything is truly possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me the best. I have to go now.&lt;/p&gt;

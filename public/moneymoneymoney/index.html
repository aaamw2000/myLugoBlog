<p>I do not know how to begin with this comrades, but I am saddened to say it &mdash; I need the cash. Life is in no way, shape, or form easy at the current moment. I have literally lost everything and I am more or less starting all over.</p>
<p>For instance, I have an oral exam tomorrow for a course I did not study much for, yet I am here typing this out. Who would have thought, huh? I certainly would not have expected me to end up here. But I guess everything is truly possible.</p>
<p>Wish me the best. I have to go now.</p>

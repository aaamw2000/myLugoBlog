## I hate that

I hate it so much. I wish I was "normal" -- whatever that is. I am truly different in (almost) every possible way. I think differently, value differnet things, and behave in an entirely differnet fashion. There is no other way around it -- I am just different.

## Education?

Could this truly be an educational gap? Or am I sucking myself off big time here? In a sense, I feel like everything I read is in fact a factor, but is it the only one? Probably not. And as I am pretty sure lots of people will point out, my lack of family and/or my childhood isolation is also a factor -- no avoiding that fact either.

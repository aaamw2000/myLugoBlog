## Welcome, friends!

Here is where I share my thoughts about every other vanilla topic out there --- I've gone through so much drama already.

I plan for this tiny static website to be my online shelf of sorts. I want it to be a place where my thoughts reside --- and maybe some recipes too. Expect mostly journal entries. And expect them every now and then; I don't plan on having a schedule for this.

I am also thinking about doing some tutorials and writing articles about interesting stuff I encounter while studying. But that's not here or there. I don't want to commit to anything so far.
